    <h1>Color choice and why: </h1>
    <p>I think I want to emulate the colors on the logo that I chose (found in the <a href="index.html">home</a> screen). I think pink and purple are really grabby colors, and they both are often regarded as similar colors. Just one is dark and the other light! Which sets the "weather" tone very nicely. These colors will apply to the navigation bar at the tap, and most likely the background of the whole page.</p>
